# CS 601 - HW 2

This JavaScript project parses a JSON file hosted on my personal github and pulls the information to display various books and movies on the DOM. These can then be categorized based on the type of media it is using the HTML Drag and Drop API.

For ease of source control, my entire application is hosted on a GitHub pages site: 
karensbuggin.github.io/CS601-HW2
JSON file: karensbuggin.github.io/CS601-HW2/media.json
